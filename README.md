📦 Project: SQL-Based E-Commerce Data Analysis
📝 Background
Amazon, a global leader in e-commerce, has achieved significant success in markets like the U.S., Europe, and Asia. In Brazil, Amazon connects small and medium businesses with millions of customers, becoming a key player. Given the similarities between Brazil and India—such as large populations and diverse consumer bases—there’s an opportunity to replicate this success in India.

As a data analyst for Amazon India, the task is to analyse Amazon Brazil's data to identify trends, customer behaviours, and preferences that could be leveraged in the Indian market. This analysis will help Amazon India make informed decisions, enhance customer experience, and seize new opportunities.

🧾 Overview of the Schema
The database schema consists of seven interconnected tables that provide insights into the operations of Amazon Brazil:

Customers: Holds customer information, including unique identifiers and locations, to study customer demographics and behavior.

Orders: Captures details about each order, such as order status and timestamps, essential for tracking the order lifecycle.

Order Items: Lists each item in an order with details like price, seller, and shipping information.

Product: Contains product specifications, such as category, size, and weight, for product-level analysis.

Seller: Provides data about sellers, including their location and unique identifiers, to evaluate seller performance.

Payments: Records transaction details, such as payment type and value, to understand payment preferences and financial performance.
