üì¶ Project: SQL-Based E-Commerce Data Analysis 

üìù Background
Amazon, a global leader in e-commerce, has achieved significant success in markets like the U.S., Europe, and Asia. In Brazil, Amazon connects small and medium businesses with millions of customers, becoming a key player. Given the similarities between Brazil and India‚Äîsuch as large populations and diverse consumer bases‚Äîthere‚Äôs an opportunity to replicate this success in India.

As a data analyst for Amazon India, the task is to analyse Amazon Brazil's data to identify trends, customer behaviours, and preferences that could be leveraged in the Indian market. This analysis will help Amazon India make informed decisions, enhance customer experience, and seize new opportunities.
